# NBodyUnityECS
This is a first version NBody experiment with ECS
Welcome to the NBodyUnityECS wiki! This is just the first version of a simple experiment to test the power of Unity ECS for an NBody simulator. There are a couple of compute shader experiments out there (I took as a base the math from this example: https://mickyd.wordpress.com/2014/02/01/n-body-galaxy-simulation-using-compute-shaders-on-gpgpu-via-unity-3d/) But so far not so much into UnityECS implementation. As of now, the ECS version of unity is still on preview, and maybe that is why there hasn't been that much experimenting. Try this out if you like, it's not perfect (far from it) but it holds for around 300k bodies on my laptop Also, this is only testing bodies against the main star, so it is yet too simple to be called an "NBody", but as I've said, just the first version for now :)
